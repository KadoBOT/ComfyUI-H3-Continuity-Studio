"""Replacement bridges: a reviewed region around a cut that a generated candidate replaces with exactly as many
frames, so the sequence keeps its duration and a locked recording keeps its place. Pure Python.

C' frames of the surviving footage before the region and freezes E' frames of the surviving footage after it, each
